# Ikhlak Shaikh — Portfolio

👋 About Me

I'm Ikhlak Shaikh, a full‑stack software engineer with over 7+ years of professional experience building scalable web applications. I specialize in React/Next.js, Node.js, and modern cloud platforms like AWS and Azure. My work spans front‑end and back‑end development, with a focus on clean code, testing, and delivering solutions that improve user experience and business efficiency.

I enjoy tackling challenging problems, learning new technologies quickly, and collaborating with cross‑functional teams to bring ideas to life. Outside of coding, I’m passionate about travel and exploring creative design.

## 🧩 Customization

- **Branding:** Update colors, fonts, and spacing in `tailwind.config.ts`.
- **Meta/SEO:** Define default metadata in `app/layout.tsx` (or the relevant layout file) via Next’s `metadata` export.
- **Content:** Add/update project entries (title, description, tech, links) in your chosen data source (JSON/TS file or inline in `app/` components).
- **Analytics:** Add your provider (e.g., Vercel Analytics) in the layout or a dedicated client component.

---

## 📦 Deployment

- **Vercel (recommended):** Import the repo and deploy. Next.js is supported natively.
- **Static export:** If you opt into `next export`, ensure all routes are compatible.

**Live Demo:** [Portfolio on Vercel](https://iki789.vercel.app/)\
